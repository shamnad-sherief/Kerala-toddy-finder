## Code Standards
- **Python**: Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/). We use `flake8` for linting and `pre-commit` hooks to ensure standards are met before committing.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: Use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for code formatting.

## Dependency Management & Dependabot
To ensure our dependencies remain secure and up to date, this project utilizes **Dependabot**.
- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot runs weekly to check for updates in `github-actions`, `toddy_shop_backend` (Python/uv), and `toddy_shop_frontend` (Node/npm).
- **Grouped Pull Requests**: To minimize PR noise, Dependabot is configured to group updates by ecosystem (e.g., all frontend dependencies will be bundled into a single PR).
- **Review Process**: When reviewing Dependabot PRs, please ensure that CI checks pass and there are no breaking changes before merging.

## Pull Request Process
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new feature branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
3. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add your message here"
   ```
4. Push to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
5. Create a pull request to the main repository.
